# Notebooks README

This sub-directory serves as documentation for learning image classification and `keras` neural network implementation.

## Structure

Here is a simple outline for the folder but will be changed when more changes are made to the project. Important to state again that the `sklearn` implementation will not be iterated on from now on. Although you are welcome to build on this version! (Ensemble learners are my favorite!)

+ `00_image_manipulation_pract` - contains notebook with simple image manipulation that is not machine learning centric. Was just a simple introduction to get me comfortable with image manipulation with Python
+ `01_mnist_practice` - first implementation of MNIST data set, containing images of 8x8 pixels. Utilizes `sklearn`.
+ `02_mnist` - documentation containing `keras` implementation, will serve as main directory for work for entire project.
