# Image Classification with MNIST

Repo serves as documentation towards my progression through image classification, focusing on the famous [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and Python. The Repo is broken into 3 parts:

+ Practice with Image Manipulation
+ Practice with `sklearn`'s sample MNIST data set
+ Practice with `keras` and original data set downloaded from previously linked data source.

Currently there are only notebooks with the same structure within the `notebooks folder`. More information can be found there regarding implementation of models.

`sklearn` was done not knowing that this wasn't the complete dataset, so it won't be iterated on and will stay to serve as a baseline or introduction to modeling for people not familiar with classification.

This repository will focus on *neural networks* and `keras`, if you have any questions please let me know!
